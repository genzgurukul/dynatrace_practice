**Analyzing Thread related problem with Dynatrace**

Thread-related issues in an application can led to **performance degradation**, **application hangs**, or **high CPU usage**. With **Dynatrace**, you can effectively diagnose and resolve these issues using real-time monitoring, thread dumps, and CPU profiling.

**‚úÖ Thread Contention (Locking Issues)**

**Symptoms:**
- **Multiple threads waiting for a shared resource, causing slow application response.**
- **High synchronization overhead due to blocked or waiting threads.**

**üõ†Ô∏è Simulating a Thread-Related Problem**

**To better understand and analyze thread issues, let‚Äôs simulate a thread contention issue using a sample application.**
**Let‚Äôs simulate the issue using a sample application.**
**.Clone the Repository**

First, clone the **BuggyApp** repository to your local machine using the following command
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sumanth17-git/buggyApp.git
cd buggyApp
```

**üõë Simulate Blocked Threads:**

To put multiple threads in a **BLOCKED** state, invoke the app with the following command:
```bash
java -jar buggyApp.jar PROBLEM_BLOCKED
```
üí° **What happens in the background?**

- The application creates multiple threads that **continuously wait for a shared resource**.
- This leads to high thread contention, causing increased CPU usage and slow application performance.

**üîç Step-by-Step Analysis of Thread Issues in Dynatrace**

# Approach 1: Dive Deep with Method Hotspots

Now you are experiencing the Slowness in your application and response times are degrading, lets check the Process behavior. Follow the steps below

1.**Navigate to the Hosts Section**  
Go to Hosts ‚Üí Instance ‚Üí Process ‚Üí Select the Process.

2\. **Click on Detailed CPU Breakdown**  
Then, go to Background Thread CPU ‚Üí Choose Threads.

**Analyzing Thread Behavior in Dynatrace**

After following the steps above, you‚Äôll see a list of **thread groups**. In the screenshot below, you'll notice a high percentage of CPU time spent on **locking**, indicating that threads are blocked due to resource contention.

To investigate further:

1. **Click on the Thread Group**  
    Select the thread group showing high contention.
2. **Inspect the Threads**  
    You'll see a list of **locked threads** caused by thread contention.

Now below screenshot shows, these are the list of threads that are currently locked due to some reasons. Let‚Äôs find out the reason for locked threads.

**By clicking on the Method Hotspots, you can identify the underlying issue causing the threads to be locked.**


**Examine the Stack Trace**
**Look for method calls associated with your application package (com.appname.\*). This will help filter out unrelated system methods and focus on the issue at hand**
For example, the stack trace below shows that the method **getSomething** in **com.buggyapp.blockedapp** is the culprit.

**üì∏ Sharing Findings with Developers**

**Once you have identified the root cause of the problem, take a screenshot of the analysis. Share it with your developers for further resolution. In this case, you would share that getSomething in the AppObject class is the source of the thread blockage.**

# Approach 2: Quick Analysis with Continuous CPU Profiling

If you need a fast and efficient way to identify thread-related issues in your application, Continuous CPU Profiling in Dynatrace is the perfect solution. This method provides valuable insights into CPU usage at the code level, enabling you to drill down into specific methods and analyze their execution times in real-time.

**üõ†Ô∏è Steps to Perform Quick Analysis Using Continuous CPU Profiling**

1. **Navigate to Profiling & Optimization**
    - Go to the **Profiling & Optimization** section in Dynatrace and select **Continuous CPU Profiling** for the relevant process group.
    - Choose **Threads** to focus on thread-related metrics.

This will give you insights into CPU usage at a code level, allowing you to drill down into specific methods and their execution times.

**üîç Select the Process Causing Slowness**

For this example, let‚Äôs assume **BuggyApp** is causing the performance issues.

1. **Select the BuggyApp Process**  
    Find and select **BuggyApp** from your list of processes.

**Right-Click on BuggyApp**  
Right-click on **BuggyApp** and choose **Threads** to open the thread analysis screen.

**üìä Analyzing Thread Behavior**

On the **Thread Analysis** screen, you'll see a list of threads that are currently **locked**. These threads are waiting for resources and causing the application to slow down.


1. **Investigate the Locked Threads**  
    Click on the thread group to further explore why these threads are in a **locked state**.

**üí° Identifying the Root Cause**

To quickly pinpoint the source of the thread lock, follow these steps:

1. Click on Method Hotspots  
    By selecting Method Hotspots, Dynatrace will highlight the method causing the threads to be locked.
2. Examine the Stack Trace  
    Look for method calls related to your application package (e.g., com.appname). This allows you to filter out irrelevant system methods and focus on the issue affecting your application.

For example, the stack trace below shows that the method **getSomething** in **com.buggyapp.blockedapp** is the culprit.
