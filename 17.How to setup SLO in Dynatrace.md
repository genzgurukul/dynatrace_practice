**📊 Understanding SLOs in Dynatrace**

Service Level Objectives (**SLOs**) help teams measure **service reliability and performance** based on key metrics. Dynatrace allows you to set up, evaluate, and monitor SLOs to ensure your services meet expected performance standards.

**📌 Key Components of an SLO**

📌 **Service-Level Indicator (SLI)** – The metric used to measure successful service delivery (e.g., service success rate, crash-free mobile app users, response time).

🎯 **Target** – The expected goal for service performance (e.g., 99.99% of requests should return without errors).

🕒 **Evaluation Period** – Defines the timeframe for measuring the SLO to ensure consistent reporting.

📈 **SLO Status** – The current evaluation result, expressed as a percentage (e.g., **99.3% of requests are successful**).

**📌 Selecting the Right SLO Indicators**

    🟢 **Service-Level Availability SLO** – Measures service availability by dividing the number of successful service calls by the total service calls.

    🔹 **Service-Method Availability SLO** – Tracks key request success rates.

    ⚡ **Service Performance SLO** – Evaluates service performance based on "good minutes" vs. "total minutes."

    😊 **User Experience SLO** – Based on **Apdex**, measuring the percentage of **satisfied users**.

    📱 **Mobile Crash-Free Users SLO** – Calculates the **percentage of users without app crashes**.

    🧪 **Synthetic Availability SLO** – Tracks **successful synthetic test executions** vs. total executions.


**📊 General Formula for SLO Calculation**

📌 **SLO Formula**:

(100)\*(Good events)/(Total Events)

**🚀 Step-by-Step Guide to Creating SLOs in Dynatrace**

**1️.Service Availability SLO**

📌 **Goal**: Ensure service availability over a specific period (week, month, or quarter).

**🛠 Steps to Create a Service Availability SLO**

1️.**Open the Service-Level Objectives** section in Dynatrace.

2️.**Click "Add New SLO"**.

3️.**Choose "Service-Level Availability"**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/211e0f3d-3ed3-497a-8fd5-28e735de212a)

4️.**Define Metrics** (Leave default settings).

5️.**Apply Filters**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d50f279-ac04-4b11-9829-e04cfb00ed0d)

- Use entity selectors or tags to specify the services to track:

- type("SERVICE"), entityName("bookingService")
    - entityId("SERVICE-504937"), mzName("Production")
    - type("MOBILE_APPLICATION"), tag("key:value")  
**Click "Preview"** to validate the selection.

7️.**Define Success Criteria** (e.g., 97% availability with 3% failure tolerance).

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16c92455-b337-4bb9-afaf-2a01d9e504dd)

8️.**Click "Evaluate"** to test the SLO.

9️⃣ **Save the SLO for monitoring**.

Setup is ready .SLO for CCSB_BANK_PaymentService ensuring **99.9% uptime**.

**2️. Request-Level SLO (Individual Requests)**

📌 **Goal**: Monitor availability of a specific **API endpoint**.

**🛠 Steps to Create a Request-Level SLO**

1️.**Create Two Metrics**:

- 📊 **Total Events** → Total number of requests.

- ✅ **Good Events** → Number of successful requests.

2️.**Use Multi-Dimensional Analysis** to filter requests.  
3️.**Create Metrics** based on key filters (e.g., bookingService).  
4️.**Set up the SLO using the created metrics**.  
5️.**Define Success Criteria** (e.g., **98% success rate**).

6️.**Evaluate & Save** the SLO.

**3️.Response Time SLO**

📌 **Goal**: Ensure requests complete within a defined **response time** (e.g., **95% under 5 seconds**).

3.**Service Response time Availability – Individual Request Response time SLO**

To Create the SLO for individual or group of requests response time, you need to create two new metrics.

1.Total number of requests hitting the endpoint **Total Events**

2\. Total number of requests – response time less than 5 seconds **Good Events**

**Total Events Create a metric - Total number of requests hitting the endpoint**

You can create the metrics from multi-dimensional analysis , do the filter like this.

To create a metric, go to multi-dimensional analysis – apply the filter and click create metric and give some name.

**calc:service.bookingfinishcount**

**Good Events** Create a next metric is to have only requests which took less than 5 seconds

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a9f8902-4e0e-40eb-a6da-296cc8ec4458)

Now you have created two metrics , using these we can create a new SLO for Response time like below

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66cf23d2-3dda-420b-a894-639aeb0883fa)

And remove the Define a filter (it should be empty) and add success criteria.

And click evaluate and save.

Like wise you can create the SLO for Synthetic monitoring
