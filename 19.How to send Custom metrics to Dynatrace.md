# Sending Custom Metrics from a Spring Boot Application to Dynatrace in Kubernetes
We have already setup the OneAgent on Kubernetes cluster and it is capture the telemetry data(metrics,logs,traces) to Dynatrace Console.

Sometimes, you might require sending custom metrics which is created by application code which is important for your key business metrics.

Your **Spring Boot application** is already instrumented with **custom business metrics** using **Micrometer** and needs to send them to **Dynatrace** for monitoring.

<https://github.com/Sumanth17-git/SRETraining/tree/main/springboot-microservice-logging>

For example, Below are my springboot application source code repository
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb2c56ab-3a35-48c5-a1cd-d5cd5b5da32a)

Below are the metrics are created from application code. Now I want to push these metrics to Dynatrace console.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/816184fd-b139-4edb-a812-c26b41d35172)

```bash
public JsonResponseController(MeterRegistry registry) {
this.requestCounter = registry.counter("api.json.requests.count");
this.transactionTimer = registry.timer("api.json.transaction.timer");
this.productViewCounter = registry.counter("api.product.views.count");
```

**Step 1: Deploy the Application in Kubernetes**

1. **Connect to your Kubernetes cluster using GCP CLI:**

**gcloud container clusters get-credentials cluster-1 --zone us-central1-c --project aiops-447509**

**Ensure that your Spring Boot deployment is properly annotated** to allow Dynatrace to scrape custom metrics.

Your deployment_dynatrace.yml file should contain the following annotations:

<https://github.com/Sumanth17-git/SRETraining/blob/main/springboot-microservice-logging/deployment_dynatrace.yml>
```bash
annotations:
      metrics.dynatrace.com/scrape: "true" # Enable Dynatrace scraping
      metrics.dynatrace.com/path: "/actuator/prometheus" # Path for Prometheus metrics
      metrics.dynatrace.com/port: "8881" # Port for Dynatrace
      metrics.dynatrace.com/secure: "false" # Set to false for HTTP
```
Apply the deployment in Kubernetes:
```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment_dynatrace.yml
```
**Verify Metrics Exposure**

Ensure that your Spring Boot application is correctly exposing the custom metrics. You can do this by accessing the /actuator/prometheus endpoint (or /actuator/metrics if you're using Micrometer) directly from your application.
- Example: If your application is running on http://your-app;:8080, try accessing http://your-app:8080/actuator/prometheus to see if the custom metrics are being exposed.
- Expected output should include custom metrics like: **api_json_requests_count 45.0**

Once the application is running, verify that it exposes the metrics.

Check if the application is running
```bash
kubectl get pods
```

**Step 2: Check OneAgent Configuration**

Ensure that the OneAgent is properly configured to scrape metrics from your application. The OneAgent should automatically discover and scrape metrics from endpoints like /actuator/prometheus.

**Enable Prometheus Metrics Ingestion**

- Dynatrace supports ingesting Prometheus metrics. Ensure that you have enabled Prometheus metrics ingestion in your Dynatrace environment.
- Go to **Settings > Cloud and virtualization > Kubernetes** in the Dynatrace console and ensure that the annotated prometheus exporters feature is enabled.

**Restart OneAgent**

- Sometimes, restarting the OneAgent can resolve issues with metric discovery.
- You can restart the OneAgent by deleting the OneAgent pod in your Kubernetes cluster, and it will be automatically restarted.

**Step 6: Validate Metrics in Dynatrace**

After restarting OneAgent

- Go to **Dynatrace Console â†’ Metrics**
- Search for:

```bash
api.json.requests.count
api.json.transaction.timer
api.product.views.count
```
