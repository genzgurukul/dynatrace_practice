**Analyzing High CPU Issues Due to I/O Problems with Dynatrace**

Experiencing high CPU usage can be challenging, but with Dynatrace, you can efficiently identify and address the root causes. This guide provides a step-by-step approach to analyzing high CPU usage caused by I/O problems.

**üõ†Ô∏è Simulating High CPU Usage Due to I/O Issues**

**To better understand and analyze high CPU consumption caused by I/O operations, let‚Äôs simulate the issue using a sample application.**

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository**

First, clone the **BuggyApp** repository to your local machine using the following command

git clone <https://github.com/Sumanth17-git/buggyApp.git>

**üíæ Simulate Heavy I/O Activity:**

To simulate **heavy I/O** activity, run the following command:

&nbsp;java -jar buggyApp.jar PROBLEM_IO

üíæ **What happens in the background?**

- The application creates five files:  
    **fileIO-1.txt, fileIO-2.txt, fileIO-3.txt, fileIO-4.txt, fileIO-5.txt.**
- It continuously writes **20 lines** of content into these files and reads them back infinitely.
- This causes excessive I/O operations, **spiking CPU usage up to 90%**.

**This will spike the CPU usage to 90%**

**üîç Step-by-Step Analysis of High CPU Usage in Dynatrace**

**Step 1: Access the Host and Processes**

- **Navigate to Host ‚Üí Process ‚Üí Method Hotspots in the Dynatrace console.**
- **Alternatively, go to Profiling & Optimization ‚Üí Continuous CPU Profiling ‚Üí Method Hotspots.**

ÀôQ‚Ä¢ **Approach 1: Dive Deep with Method Hotspots**

**Access the Host and Processes:**

‚ûú‚¨õ **Navigate to the Host section in Dynatrace and select the specific process experiencing high CPU usage.**

**1\. Identify CPU System and I/O Wait Usage**

- **In Dynatrace, analyze the CPU usage graph to check if the spike is due to CPU system or CPU I/O wait.**
- **Compare the CPU chart with Disk IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second) to determine if I/O activity is causing the CPU load.**

**2.Locate CPU-Intensive I/O Processes**

- **Scroll down to the Process Analysis section to identify the process consuming the most CPU.**
- **Look for processes like buggyApp.jar, which might be performing heavy disk writes.**

**Find the Process which consume Disk Writes**

**Analyze Method Hotspots**

- **Select buggyApp.jar and click on View Detailed CPU Breakdown.**
- **Navigate to Background Processes ‚Üí Click "‚Ä¶" ‚Üí Method Hotspots.**
- **Focus on methods consuming the highest CPU resources.**

**Choose background process ü°™ Click ‚Ä¶ method hotspot**

‚óè **Focus on Method Hotspots to identify code execution paths consuming most of the CPU.**

**Drill Down into Call Hierarchies**

- **Analyze the Call Hierarchy to pinpoint the exact code responsible for high CPU usage.**
- **In this case, the com.buggyapp.util.FileUtil class and write method are consuming 97% of CPU resources.**
- **This confirms that excessive file writing operations are the root cause of the high CPU usage.**

**Key Tip: Focus on Application-Specific Methods**

**When analyzing CPU usage, prioritize methods from your application package (e.g., com.appname). This ensures you isolate application-related performance issues rather than being distracted by system or third-party libraries.**

# Approach 2: Quick Analysis with Continuous CPU Profiling
**1\. Utilize Continuous CPU Profiling:**
‚¨õ/ Go to **Profiling & Optimization** and select **Continuous CPU Profiling** for the relevant process group.
This will give you insights into CPU usage at a code level, allowing you to drill down into specific methods and their execution times.

**Identify the Root Cause:**

**Again, use Method Hotspots to trace the root cause in your application's package.**

Check the call hierarchy to find the problematic code belongs to your application package for root cause. Here , the call hierarchy show ,the below package (com.buggapp.fileutil.write) and method name : write is consuming 100% which is root cause of this issue.

**‚úÖ Conclusion: Reducing Mean Time to Detection (MTTD)**

By following this structured approach, you can:  
‚úîÔ∏è **Quickly identify the root cause of high CPU usage**  
‚úîÔ∏è **Determine whether the issue is related to I/O operations**  
‚úîÔ∏è **Optimize code performance and reduce unnecessary I/O activities**

This ensures faster issue resolution, significantly reducing **Mean Time to Detection (MTTD)** and improving overall system performance.
