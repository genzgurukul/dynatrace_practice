# How to identify the Root Cause of Database Connection Pooling issues

**What is Database Connection Polling?**
Database Connection Pooling is a technique used to manage database connections efficiently by reusing a set of pre-established connections rather than creating and destroying connections for every request. This improves performance and reduces the overhead of establishing new connections repeatedly.
However, polling issues can arise when connections are not managed properly, leading to various failures, such as connection exhaustion, slow queries, or application crashes.

**Common Database Connection Pooling Issues**
ðŸ”´**Issue 1:**
**The application creates too many connections, exceeding the database limit.**
The database may start rejecting new connections, leading to Too many connections or Connection timeout errors.

ðŸ”´**Issue 2**

**Application opens database connections but never closes them.**
Leads to a steady increase in open connections, eventually causing database overload.
