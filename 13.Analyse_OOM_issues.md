# How to find Root cause of  OutOfMemory issue using Dynatrace in just 5 Minutes

**Why Does an OutOfMemoryError (OOM) Occur in Java?**

An **OutOfMemoryError** occurs when a Java application runs out of memory and cannot allocate more objects. This can happen due to inefficient memory management, memory leaks, or excessive memory consumption beyond the allocated heap/non-heap space.

**üöÄ How Java Triggers an OutOfMemoryError (OOM)**

Java throws an OutOfMemoryError when it cannot allocate memory for new objects. The error message varies based on the memory area causing the issue.

**üîπ 1. Java Heap Space OOM**

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space

üîç **Why It Happens?**

- Creating large objects or too many objects.
- Holding references to objects unnecessarily (memory leak).

Let‚Äôs analyse the OutOfMemory issue using dynatrace , I am going to show you how to find the root cause of OOM issue and problematic code caused this issue.

As you can see the Dynatrace has reported the long garbage collection time and Memory resources exhausted alert due to OOM issue.

Since an **OOM error** has occurred, the application experiences **slowness and eventually becomes unresponsive**.

At this point, the application cannot process/respond to any user requests. All requests result in errors or timeouts.

**üïµÔ∏è Finding the Root Cause in 5 Minutes**

**Step 2: Process Monitoring**

**Click on the problem in Dynatrace as per the screenshot.**

**Look at the Suspension Usage Chart and If it shows 100% usage, it means the Garbage Collection time is fully consumed.**

But this is not enough! We need to **find the problematic code** causing the OutOfMemory issue. Only then can we fix it by updating the **JVM configuration** or **optimizing the code**.

**Step 3: Analyze Suspension**

Click on **Analyze Suspension** to open the **Memory Profiling** screen.

Dynatrace provides **in-depth memory allocation monitoring**, allowing **fine-grained allocation analysis** and pinpointing the root cause.

**Understanding the Flame Graph**

When analyzing a flame graph, follow a **top-to-bottom** approach.

1. **Identify the Starting Point**
    - The top stack trace represents the **entry point** of the thread, typically thread.run().
2. **Locate the Application Code**
    - Application-specific code is highlighted in **orange**.
    - In this case, it belongs to the package:  
        com.example.memoryleak.simulator.service.
    - The execution path involves the **MemoryLeakTask** class.
3. **Find the Last Executed Application Code**
    - The **final application method** before transitioning to native Java code is updatePayment().
    - After updatePayment(), the execution proceeds to HashMap.put().
4. **Analyze the Issue**
    - The updatePayment() method from **MemoryLeakService.java** is inserting data into a **HashMap**.
    - These HashMap objects are **not being garbage collected**, leading to a continuous increase in **heap memory usage**.
    - This indicates a **potential memory leak** in the application.

# Quick -Click Analysis to Find the Root Cause

To **quickly identify** the root cause of the **OOM error** in **under 5 minutes**, follow these steps:

**I am going to do only 4 clicks to find the Root cause**

**Click 1 : Go to profiling and optimization**

**Root Cause Identified**

- **Class File**: MemoryLeakService.java
- **Method**: updatePayment
- **Issue**: updatePayment creates a **HashMap** to store random values.
- **Problem**: The **HashMap is not getting garbage collected**, leading to **high heap memory usage**.

**Next Steps**

1. **Have We Found the Root Cause?**
    - Yes, we have identified that the updatePayment() method in MemoryLeakService.java (package: com.example.memoryleak.simulator.service) is causing high memory usage due to objects being stored in a HashMap without proper garbage collection.
2. **What‚Äôs Next?**
    - Capture a **screenshot** of the flame graph and share it with the developers.
3. **Thinking Like a Developer**
    - Upon receiving these details, the developer will:
        - Navigate to the **code repository** at com.example.memoryleak.simulator.service.

**Class File : MemoryleakService.Java**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dfffffc7-ef8f-4dbf-9c14-0859a786774f)

Open the Class file, we have found the problematic highest object allocation method **updatePayment**

We can analyze the updatePayment method in the code to understand its behavior. Upon inspection, we can see that it creates a HashMap object to store random string values, which is the root cause of the issue.

Developer **reviews the code** in MemoryLeakService.java:
```bash
public void updatePayment() {

Map&lt;String, String&gt; map = new HashMap<>();
while (true) {
map.put(UUID.randomUUID().toString(), "Sample Data");
}
}
```
Apply best practices:

- Use **ConcurrentHashMap** instead of HashMap.
- Implement **proper cache eviction**.
- Limit **unbounded memory allocations**.

‚úÖ **Fixed Code Example**:
```bash
public void updatePayment() {
String map = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
map.put(UUID.randomUUID().toString(), "Sample Data");
}
}
```
With **Dynatrace**, we can **quickly** analyze **OOM errors**, identify problematic code, and help developers fix memory issues efficiently.

‚úÖ **Best Practice**: Always monitor memory allocation and optimize garbage collection strategies to **prevent OOM errors** in production!
