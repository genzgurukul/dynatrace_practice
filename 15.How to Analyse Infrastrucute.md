# How to Analyze Infrastructure with Dynatrace

**Problem Statement:** When problems happen in the infrastructure its important to quickly have access to all relevant data!

**How Dynatrace helps:** Dynatrace' Host App provides a single point of view for everything needed when managing infrastructure such as hosts (physical, virtual or cloud): Metrics, Logs, Events, Vulnerabilities, Dependencies, Ownership

**Steps**:

1. Open the [Hosts App](https://wkf10640.apps.dynatrace.com/ui/apps/dynatrace.classic.hosts/#newhosts)
2.Select a host

3.Expand the timeframe

**2: Analyze Hosts and root cause of CPU, Memory, Disk or Network spikes**

**Problem Statement:** When a host runs high on CPU, Memory, Disk or Network Utilization the question is what is causing this

**How Dynatrace helps:** Dynatrace's Host App provides full visibility into the host and all running processes. Davis Analyzer can be used for ad-hoc analysis of spikes of CPUs, Disk, Network (or any other metric) and finds the correlating metric

**Steps**

1. Select a host through the [Hosts App](https://wkf10640.apps.dynatrace.com/ui/apps/dynatrace.classic.hosts/#newhosts)
2. Select a metric you want to explore, e.g: System Load
3. Select a significant enough timeframe that has the pattern in the middle of the data set
4. Once the Analyze button becomes available select the metric ![A screenshot of a computer

5. Analyze the most relevant metrics that correlate with the reference metric
