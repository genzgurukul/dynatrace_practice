**🌐 Creating a GKE Cluster**

Follow these steps to create a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster in the Google Cloud Console.

**🖥️ Go to Kubernetes Engine**

- First, navigate to the Kubernetes Engine section of the Google Cloud Console, where you will manage all your Kubernetes clusters.
- **Steps**:
  - Go to the **Google Cloud Console**.
  - In the **left sidebar**, click on **Kubernetes Engine** and then **Clusters**.

**🔧 Choose Cluster Type**

- Select the type of cluster that you want to create. For most production and development scenarios, the **Standard Cluster** is the most appropriate.
- **Steps**:
  - In the **Cluster Type** section, choose **Standard Cluster**.
- Click the **Configure** button to customize the cluster settings.

**📍 Cluster Location**

- Choose where your cluster will run geographically. This determines latency and availability.
- **Steps**:
  - Choose **Location Type** as **Zonal**.
  - Optionally, select a specific zone in the region.

**Number of Nodes : 1** ( as we are using free trail , better to use 1 node)

**🖱️ Node Pool Configuration**

- A node pool is a group of nodes (VMs) within your cluster. You will need to set the node pool configuration to define how many nodes and what types of machines will be used.
- **Steps**:
  - Under **Node Pools**, choose **default-pool** (or create a new one).
  - Set **Number of Nodes** to **1** to start with a single node (adjust later as needed).

In the **Machine Type** field, select **e2-standard-4** (4 vCPUs, 16 GB RAM). This is a balanced machine type suitable for most workloads.

**💾 Set Disk Size**

- Configure the size of the boot disk for your nodes. This disk stores the operating system and data.
- **Steps**:
  - Set the **Boot Disk Size** to **100 GB** to provide ample storage for your workloads.

**💡 Enable Spot VMs**

- Spot VMs are low-cost, short-term VMs that Google can reclaim when needed. Enabling them can reduce your costs, but they may be terminated at any time.
- **Steps**:
  - If cost reduction is important, check **Enable node on spot VMs** to use cheaper VMs.

✅ Create the Cluster

Leave the default settings unchanged for other configurations (unless you want to adjust network or security settings).
