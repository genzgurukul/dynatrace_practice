**🌍 Setting Up Your Google Cloud Account**

**In this section, I will guide you through the process of creating a Google Cloud account.**

**🚀 Why Google Cloud?**

**I have chosen Google Cloud for this course because it offers a 90-day free trial with zero cost. During this period, you can access a wide range of Google Cloud services, including:  
**✅ Compute Engine (Virtual Machines)  
✅ Kubernetes Engine (Managed Kubernetes clusters)  
✅ Up to 12 vCPU cores for various workloads

**This level of flexibility is not available in other major cloud providers like AWS and Azure, which have more restrictive free-tier limits.**
