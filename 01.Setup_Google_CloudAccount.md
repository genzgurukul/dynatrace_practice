**🌍 Setting Up Your Google Cloud Account**

**In this section, I will guide you through the process of creating a Google Cloud account.**

**🚀 Why Google Cloud?**

**I have chosen Google Cloud for this course because it offers a 90-day free trial with zero cost. During this period, you can access a wide range of Google Cloud services, including:  
**✅ Compute Engine (Virtual Machines)  
✅ Kubernetes Engine (Managed Kubernetes clusters)  
✅ Up to 12 vCPU cores for various workloads

**This level of flexibility is not available in other major cloud providers like AWS and Azure, which have more restrictive free-tier limits.**

Now that you have successfully created your **Google Cloud** account, the next step is to set up the essential services required for **Dynatrace monitoring**. We will focus on provisioning a **Compute Engine instance**, which will act as our test environment.

**🔧 Setting Up and Configuring Google Cloud Compute Instance**

**Step 1: Access the Google Cloud Console**

Open the **Navigation Menu** on the left side.

In the navigation menu, go to **Compute Engine** → **VM Instances**.
