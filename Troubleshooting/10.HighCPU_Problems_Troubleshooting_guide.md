**Experiencing high CPU usage can be challenging, but with Dynatrace, you can**

**pinpoint and address the root causes efficiently. Here's a concise guide to help you navigate the process:**

**Let‚Äôs simulate the High CPU Problem**

**üõ†Ô∏è Steps to Simulate Problems**

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    - First, clone the **BuggyApp** repository to your local machine using the following command
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sumanth17-git/buggyApp.git
```
**üîß Simulate CPU Spike:**

To simulate a **CPU spike**, invoke the **buggyApp.jar** with the following command:

```bash
java -jar buggyApp.jar PROBLEM_CPU
```
**This will spike the CPU usage to 90%**

**Let‚Äôs check how to analyse this problem with step by step approach**

When you experience High CPU issue on the host

1. Host ÔÉ† Process-- > Method Hotspots
2. Profiling & Optimization -ÔÉ† continuous CPU profiling -ÔÉ† Method Hotspots
   
# Approach 1: Dive Deep with Method Hotspots

**Access the Host and Processes:**
‚ûú‚¨õ **Navigate to the Host section in Dynatrace and select the specific process experiencing high CPU usage.**

1. **Identify CPU-Intensive Processes:**
Q‚Ä¢Àô **Scroll down to process analysis to find which process, like buggyApp.jar, consumes the most CPU.**

1. **Analyze Method Hotspots:**
**Select the process and click on View detailed CPU Breakdown.**

‚óè **Focus on Method Hotspots to identify code execution paths consuming most of the CPU.**

1. **Check Call Hierarchies:**
**Drill down into the call hierarchy to locate problematic code within your application package, such as com.buggapp.cpuspike, which might be the root cause of high CPU usage.**

**Key Tip:**

‚óè **Focus on Application-Specific Methods**

When analyzing CPU usage in Dynatrace, it's essential to drill down into the methods that consume the most resources. Here‚Äôs a key tip to enhance your analysis:

- - Target Application Packages: Always concentrate on methods that belong to your application package, which typically starts with com.appname. By focusing on these specific methods, you can effectively isolate performance issues related to your application rather than being distracted by system or third-party libraries.

This targeted approach allows you to identify inefficiencies or bottlenecks within your own codebase, leading to more actionable insights and optimization opportunities.

# Approach 2: Quick Analysis with Continuous CPU Profiling
1. Utilize Continuous CPU Profiling:

 ‚¨õ/ Go to **Profiling & Optimization** and select **Continuous CPU Profiling** for the relevant process group.

This will give you insights into CPU usage at a code level, allowing you to drill down into specific methods and their execution times.

**Identify the Root Cause:**
‚Ä¢Àô **Again, use Method Hotspots to trace the root cause in your application's package.**

Check the call hierarchy to find the problematic code belongs to your application package for root cause. Here , the call hierarchy show ,the below package (com.buggapp.cpuspike) and method name : cpuspike is consuming 100% which is root cause of this issue.

That‚Äôs it , you have found the root cause of the High CPU issue in less MTTD.
By following these steps, you can swiftly identify and resolve high CPU usage issues, reducing Mean Time to Detection (MTTD) and improving system performance.
