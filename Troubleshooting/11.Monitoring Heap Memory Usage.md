üß† **Monitoring Heap Memory Usage: A Step-by-Step Guide to Detect and Resolve Memory Issues**

**Why Heap Memory Usage Matters**

Heap memory is where Java allocates memory for objects. Keeping an eye on heap memory usage is crucial because it helps identify whether an application is consuming excessive memory, leading to performance problems or even crashes. In particular, when heap memory usage gradually increases over time, it can signal potential issues like memory leaks, which need to be addressed before they escalate.

**Step 1: Check Host Memory Usage**

Start by monitoring the overall memory usage on the host. If you see a steady increase in memory usage, it could indicate that an application is consuming more memory than expected. This is usually the first sign that something isn‚Äôt quite right.

**Step 2: Identify Memory-Hogging Processes**
Next, head to the Processes section to identify which application is using up the most memory. For example, you might notice the Spring Boot MemoryLeak application is consuming around 4.36GB of memory, which is an early warning sign of a memory issue.

Choose the Springboot process and click that , it will be open process wise metrics screen.

**Step 3: Dive Deeper into Process Memory Metrics**
Once you‚Äôve identified the culprit, click on the Spring Boot process to get more detailed process-wise memory metrics. This will give you a clearer picture of the memory consumption patterns and help you pinpoint what needs attention.

**Step 4: Focus on Heap Memory and Old Generation**
When analyzing memory usage, pay close attention to the Old Generation section of the heap. This area stores objects that have a long lifespan. These objects are typically larger and can accumulate over time if not properly managed. Monitoring the Old Generation helps you spot potential memory issues early on.
‚Ä¢	Long-Lived Objects: These are objects that stay alive for a long time and can gradually increase memory usage. Watch for steady growth in memory consumption here.

**Step 5: Track Memory Growth and Garbage Collection**
As the application runs, you may notice memory usage steadily growing. While this might not be an issue initially, it‚Äôs crucial to keep monitoring it.
Once memory usage reaches its maximum capacity, garbage collection (GC) will be triggered. During GC, the system tries to reclaim unused memory by removing objects that are no longer in use. If GC time starts to increase (like the 16.7 seconds in our example), it‚Äôs a clear sign of inefficiency.

and garbage collection time spent is 16.7 seconds.

After few minutes , now you can see the heap memory usage is continuously high.

**Step 6: Monitor the Impact on Performance**
Even after garbage collection runs, you may still see high memory usage. If the memory keeps rising and GC is consistently running, the application may experience noticeable slowness. You might receive alerts about excessive garbage collection times, which can indicate that memory management needs to be addressed.

Now Alert has been triggered for garbage collection time.

**How to fix this problem ?**
Step 7: Addressing Heap Memory Issues
To resolve these issues, follow these steps:
1.	Analyze Memory Usage Patterns: Look at whether memory usage is increasing too quickly. This helps you understand the scope of the problem.
2.	Increase Heap Memory Allocation: If your current heap memory isn‚Äôt enough, you can increase it. For example, if your application is using -Xms:3g -Xmx:3g, you might increase it to -Xms:4g -Xmx:4g to give it more memory space.
