**🔧 Let's Practice: Setting Up the Lab**

**📌 Step 1: Create Virtual Machines (VMs)**

1️.**Master VM (High Specifications)**

- This will act as the Ansible control node where Ansible is installed and executed.

**2.Target VM (Medium Specifications)**

- This machine will be configured as the target where Nginx and Dynatrace OneAgent will be installed.

**🛠 Step 2: Setting Up Ansible Master on the Master VM**

Once the VM instances are ready, we begin by setting up the Ansible Master.

✅ **Connect to the instance via SSH.** Click the **SSH icon** on the right side.

Ansible Master setup is completed successfully.

✅ **Switch to the Ansible user:**
```bash
su – ansible
```
✅ **Verify SSH key generation:**
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
💡 **Keep this key handy!** It will be required while setting up the Target VM
**🖥 Step 3: Setting Up Ansible on the Target VM**
✅ **Connect to the Target/Application Server using SSH:**
```bash
sudo su
apt update -y
apt install git -y
```
✅ **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone <https://github.com/Sumanth17-git/aiops_training.git>

**✅ Setup Completed Successfully! 🎉**

Now, the environment is ready with:

✅ **Ansible Master Server** 🖥  
✅ **Target Application Server connected to Ansible Master** 🔗

Now the setup is ready . So you have Ansible Master server and One Application server which connected to ansible master server. Let’s verify the connection.

**🔍 Verification & Connection Validation**

**🔹 Step 4: Validate the Connection Between Master and Target VM**

**✅ Verify Ansible Connectivity**

On the Master Server, run the following command to ensure successful communication with the Target VM:
```bash
su – ansible
ansible all -m ping
```
If the connection is successful, you’re now ready to deploy Dynatrace OneAgent using Ansible! 🚀
\## Step 4: Validate the Connection Between Master and Target VM
1\. Create an Ansible Inventory File

To define the Target VMs for Ansible, follow these steps:

1.**Navigate to the Dynatrace OneAgent directory:**
```bash
cd dynatrace/oneagent_ansible
```
2. **Create or edit the inventory file:**
Create an inventory file (inventory.ini) on the Master VM to define the Target VMs. You can store this file in /etc/ansible/hosts or in a custom location (e.g., inventory.ini).
```bash
vi inventory.ini
```
3️.**Update the file with the internal IP addresses of the target/application servers:**
```bash
[targets]
10.150.0.9
10.150.0.8
```
```bash
ansible all -m ping -i inventory.ini
```
4️.**Validate the connection by running the following command:**
```bash
ansible all -m ping -i inventory.ini
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a857f27-8d4c-4083-b809-4b58a068656c)


✅ If the ping is successful, your Ansible setup is correctly configured and ready for deployment!
Now we have completed the Ansible master and target server setup. Now we will run some sample nginx application on target/app server by using ansible .

**3\. Installing Nginx on Target Servers Using Ansible**
**3.1 Create the Ansible Playbook**

Create a playbook install_nginx.yml to install Nginx on the target servers.
```bash
---
- name: Install Nginx on target servers
  hosts: targets  # This matches the [targets] group in your inventory file
  become: yes  # Use sudo to install packages
  tasks:
    - name: Update apt cache
      apt:
        update_cache: yes
        cache_valid_time: 3600  # Cache is valid for 1 hour
    
    - name: Install Nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present  # Ensure Nginx is installed
    
    - name: Start and enable Nginx service
      systemd:
        name: nginx
        state: started
        enabled: yes  # Ensure Nginx starts on boot

    - name: Check if Nginx is running
      command: systemctl status nginx
      register: nginx_status
      changed_when: false

    - name: Display Nginx status
      debug:
        msg: "Nginx is running: {{ nginx_status.stdout }}"

```

**2\. Running the Playbook for Nginx Deployment**
**2.1 Run the Playbook**
**Execute the following command to deploy Nginx on the target servers:**
```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini install_nginx.yml
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4bf86d0-f791-43f7-8d57-4d1eeeccd9d7)

Upon successful execution, **Ansible** will automatically install Nginx on your target servers without the need for manual intervention. This showcases the power of **Ansible** in automating the deployment process across 100+ servers effortlessly. 🚀

**Next step is deploy Oneagent on App server using ansible again without any manual installation approach i.e. one touch deployment solution.**

**3\. Deploying Dynatrace OneAgent with Ansible**

**Prerequisites**

1. **Dynatrace Account**
    - Ensure you have access to your Dynatrace environment.
    - Obtain the installation script URL from your Dynatrace environment.

**3.2 Preparing the Ansible Environment**
Connect to the Ansible Master Server
Log in to the Ansible master server:
```bash
sudo su
su -ansible
```
**Navigate to the Dynatrace OneAgent Directory**
Go to the Dynatrace OneAgent directory:
```bash
cd aiops_training/dynatrace/oneagent_ansible
```
**I have already created the playbook which can be used , you don’t have to create a new ansible playbook , you can use mine.**
**Go to dynatrace oneagent directory**

```bash
cd aiops_training/dynatrace/oneagent_ansible
```
you will have the 3 files
```bash
**\-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 152 Feb 7 09:00 vars.yml**
**\-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 32 Feb 7 09:00 inventory.ini**
**\-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 778 Feb 7 09:00 dynatrace_oneagent.yml**
```

***Vars.yml will be used to update the environment variables needed to run the plahybook***
***Inventory.ini will be used to mention the list of servers you would like to install oneagent.***
***Dynatrace_oneagent.yml is a script to install oneagent on mentioned servers in the inventory.ini list.***

**3.3 Update the Configuration in vars.yml**
