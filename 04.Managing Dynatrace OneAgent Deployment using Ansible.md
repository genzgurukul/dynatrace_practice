**🔧 Let's Practice: Setting Up the Lab**

**📌 Step 1: Create Virtual Machines (VMs)**

1️.**Master VM (High Specifications)**

- This will act as the Ansible control node where Ansible is installed and executed.

**2.Target VM (Medium Specifications)**

- This machine will be configured as the target where Nginx and Dynatrace OneAgent will be installed.

**🛠 Step 2: Setting Up Ansible Master on the Master VM**

Once the VM instances are ready, we begin by setting up the Ansible Master.

✅ **Connect to the instance via SSH.** Click the **SSH icon** on the right side.

✅ **Run the following commands:**
```bash
sudo su
apt update -y
```

✅ **Clone the GitHub repository for easy Ansible setup:**

git clone <https://github.com/Sumanth17-git/aiops_training.git>

✅ **Navigate to the setup directory & configure Ansible Master:**
```bash
cd aiops_training/ansible_projects/setup
chmod +x *
./ansible_setup_master.sh
```
This script will install all necessary dependencies and complete the Ansible Master setup. 🎯

Ansible Master setup is completed successfully.

✅ **Switch to the Ansible user:**
```bash
su – ansible
```
✅ **Verify SSH key generation:**
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
💡 **Keep this key handy!** It will be required while setting up the Target VM
**🖥 Step 3: Setting Up Ansible on the Target VM**
✅ **Connect to the Target/Application Server using SSH:**
```bash
sudo su
apt update -y
apt install git -y
```
✅ **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone <https://github.com/Sumanth17-git/aiops_training.git>
```
✅ **Navigate to the setup directory & configure Ansible Target:**
```bash
cd aiops_training/ansible_projects/setup
chmod +x \*
./setup_ansible_target.sh
```

**🔑 Copying SSH Public Key from Master VM to Target VM**
✅ **On the Master VM, retrieve the SSH public key:**
```bash
su – ansible
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
✅ **Copy the displayed SSH public key and paste it into the Target VM when prompted.**

**✅ Setup Completed Successfully! 🎉**

Now, the environment is ready with:

✅ **Ansible Master Server** 🖥  
✅ **Target Application Server connected to Ansible Master** 🔗

Now the setup is ready . So you have Ansible Master server and One Application server which connected to ansible master server. Let’s verify the connection.

**🔍 Verification & Connection Validation**

**🔹 Step 4: Validate the Connection Between Master and Target VM**

**✅ Verify Ansible Connectivity**

On the Master Server, run the following command to ensure successful communication with the Target VM:
```bash
su – ansible
ansible all -m ping
```
If the connection is successful, you’re now ready to deploy Dynatrace OneAgent using Ansible! 🚀
\## Step 4: Validate the Connection Between Master and Target VM
1\. Create an Ansible Inventory File

To define the Target VMs for Ansible, follow these steps:

1.**Navigate to the Dynatrace OneAgent directory:**
```bash
cd dynatrace/oneagent_ansible
```
2. **Create or edit the inventory file:**
Create an inventory file (inventory.ini) on the Master VM to define the Target VMs. You can store this file in /etc/ansible/hosts or in a custom location (e.g., inventory.ini).
```bash
vi inventory.ini
```
3️.**Update the file with the internal IP addresses of the target/application servers:**
```bash
\[targets\]
10.150.0.9
10.150.0.8
```
```bash
ansible all -m ping -i inventory.ini
```
4️.**Validate the connection by running the following command:**
```bash
ansible all -m ping -i inventory.ini
```
